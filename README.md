# Trangle-Point-Class
I. Design and code a class Rectangle that has the following properties:
•	Two private members double length and width
•	A constructor that accepts two parameters for the private members
•	Default constructor that sets both members to 0
•	Accessor for each private member
•	Mutator for each private member
•	Method area() that returns the area of the rectangle
•	Method Perim() that returns the perimeter of the rectangle
•	Method toString that return the param as a String 
•	Method Add that accepts a Rectangle and returns a rectangle with length as sum of lengths of this and the input rectangle and the width as the sum too.
•	Method equals() that accepts a rectangle and returns true if the two rectangles are the same and false if not.
II. Write a program to test the Rectangle class. Try to use as many of the public constructors and methods as possible.
